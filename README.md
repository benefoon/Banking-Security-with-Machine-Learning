Banking Security with Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques for detecting anomalies in banking transactions to enhance cybersecurity. The model is trained using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which identifies unusual patterns in the data.

## Features
- Preprocessing of raw banking transaction data.
- Training an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection.
- Detecting anomalies in new data and saving the results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/banking-security-ml.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd banking-security-ml
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Preprocess the data:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/preprocess.py
    ```
2. **Train the model:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/train_model.py
    ```
3. **Detect anomalies:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/detect_anomalies.py
    ```

## Results
The results of the anomaly detection are saved in `data/detection_results.csv`. Each transaction is labeled as `Anomaly` or `Normal` based on the model's prediction.
